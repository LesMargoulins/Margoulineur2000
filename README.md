## Description
__The Margoulineur2000©__ is a device that can tell you the balance of your washing machine card and overwrite it.
It is a very useful utility for smelly students and those who just want to annoy the chinese people.

## How to use it
Simply put your card on the back of the __The Margoulineur2000©__ (where the NFC module is located) and go through the menu to select the option of your choice thanks to the rotary encoder.
With just one push of a button, you can now know the balance of your card or change it to a custom amount (lower or higher).

## Disclaimer
It's not fair, but whatever.

## Specs
__The Margoulineur2000©__ is open source and can be used if you can think of any upgrade that could break their balls even more.

## Additional information
You can find dumps of dormitories 3, 4 and new 4 [here](https://github.com/LesMargoulins/Dumps "dumps")
If you're a member of the administration of the BJTU university and you want to take this repository down, well too bad, this is an _open source project_, and we will not remove it (except if you force us to lol). If by any chance you would want to change the scanners on the washing machines again, good luck.
